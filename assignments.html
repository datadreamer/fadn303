        <h4 id="1">Assignment 1: Everyone's a Critic</h4>
        <p>
          Surf the net, choose five sites, email the URL's to me by midnight before class and use GOOD/BAD WEBSITES as the subject line. Choose one site for good typography, one site that tells a good narrative, one site for innovative graphics, one for ease of use, finally select one site that needs a redesign based on one or all of the previous categories. We will be looking at these in class on Monday so be prepared to talk about your choices.
        </p>

        <h4 id="2">Assignment 2: Alphabet</h4>
        <p>
          Sign up for a Wordpress blog and become familiar with using the Dashboard by completing the following project:  Take 26 (or more) photos, one of each letter in the alphabet by roaming the streets in your neighborhood. Either find the letters A, B, C, D... Z on signs in your neighborhood or create letters with your own materials. Each image should include a letter. The word "neighborhood" is open for interpretation. Post an image of each letter to your blog every hour, for 26 consecutive hours. (Figure out how to automate this task - I do not expect students to stay awake for 26 hours in order to achieve this goal). Post the letters in alphabetical order, either A - Z or backwards (Z - A). Add captions to comment on the photos - where did you find them, what do these images have in common, why do they create a set? Make sure images are sized appropriately for the web.
        </p>

        <h4 id="3a">Assignment 3a: Style an Article</h4>
        <p>
          Find any article online with a headline, photo, and article. Restyle the article in HTML using custom fonts and the header, nav, article, footer tags as we did in class.
        </p>

        <h4 id="3b">Assignment 3b: Just the Divs</h4>
        <p>
          Do one unique page layout only as solid color divs. You do not need to fill them with any content, but you should try different layout concepts such as:
          <li>Navigation on the top.</li>
          <li>Navigation on the right.</li>
          <li>A grid of squares.</li>
          <li>An article with three columns.</li>
          <li>etc... experiment and have fun!</li>
        </p>

        <h4 id="3c">Assignment 3c: Make Your Homepage!</h4>
        <p>
          Make a fixed page layout with divs and text. This will be be your landing page for all your future assignments. You will need to include:
          <ol>
            <li>A visual identity for yourself.</li>
            <li>An about yourself pargraph with an optional graphic or picture.</li>
            <li>You will be turning in all of your future assignments through this website, so anticipate space for five more assignments. Each assignment area should have an image and a design brief of what your project is about.</li>
            <li>Links to good websites.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h4 id="4">Assignment 4: Photo Essay Gallery</h4>
        <p>
          Gather photos as a set or series of photographs that are intended to tell a story or evoke a series of emotions in the viewer. Make a photo gallery that is designed to showcase that series of images.
        </p>

        <h4 id="5">Assignment 5: Scrolling and Parallax</h4>
        <p>
          Create a scrolling or parallax website that communicates a narrative or gives step by step instructions. The website should have responsive elements that scale to different viewing devices. The design should take into account both image and text, and respond to the pacing and structure of the source material.
        </p>

        <h4 id="6">Assignment 6: Design Blog</h4>
        <p>
          Create a blog in Wordpress about a designer or design movement. The style of the blog must represent the designer through graphics and text. In the end it must have a sequential blog page with at least 12 entries that are divided into at least 3 categories. You must also have at least three other separate pages than the blog itself, such as for biographical information about the designer, a contact the author page, a links and references page, etc.
        </p>

        <h4 id="7">Assignment 7: Real Clients</h4>
        <p>
          Create a multipage or multiview website for a real client: your portfolio, a small business, a student group, etc. You may use wordpress or HTML/CSS.

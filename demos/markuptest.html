  <p>WASHINGTON - Calling the program "the most crucial in the agency's history," 		researchers at NASA announced Wednesday they have successfully deployed a 				Special Exploratory Rover to Congress as part of an open-ended mission to seek 		out any possible trace of funding on Capitol Hill.</p>

  <p>The rover, named Hope, is a remotely operated, semi-autonomous vehicle 				outfitted with ultra-sensitive equipment that can detect even the smallest 			amounts of program-sustaining revenue, NASA scientists confirmed. The unmanned 		explorer will reportedly traverse the chambers of both the Senate and House of 		Representatives, continuing its search as long as necessary.</p>
